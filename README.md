<H1># Module 10 Challenge Code</H1>
<li>This repository contains the code for my FinTech Bootcamp Module10 Challenge.</li>
<H2>Programs and Libraries Used</H2>
  <li>Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and hvplot</li>
<H3>Usage</H3>
  <li>1). To use this application, please clone the repository and open jupyterlab.</li>
  <li>2). When launching the application in the Jupyter lab notebook please run the file by clicking the run button at the top of the notepad, or under the run tab select run all cells.</li>
<H4>Purpose of the Code</H4>
<li>In this code we are assuming the role of a financial advisor. We are going to propose a new approach for creating investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of the proposal being based on the returns and volatility, as usually constructed, we are going to include other factors that could impact the cryptocurrency market.</li>
<li>In the code, I have created a Jupyter notebook thatis going to cluster the crypto currencies by their performance in different time periods. The results have been plotted in elbow curve graphs and scatter plots to visually show the performance.</li>
